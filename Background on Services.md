- Things to keep in mind for services:
	- 1. What does the service do?
		- What is the purpose of the service? 
		- What is the nature? 
		- What is it all about?
	- 2. Where are the important files?
		- Most services have configuration files, where are they? Are there multiple? 
		- Does it matter by user? Do you have a copy? 
		- Pay attention the your changes!
	- 3. Does the service require a restart?
		- Many services require a restart for changes to take effect!
		- How do you restart the service (and NOT the whole computer)? 
		- Are there other services that also need to restart? 
		- Is it running by default?
